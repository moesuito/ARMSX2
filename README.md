# ARMSX2 — Native ARM64 JIT Fork of PCSX2
[![All Platforms](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/ARMSX2/ARMSX2/build-all.yml?branch=master&label=All%20Platforms)](https://github.com/ARMSX2/ARMSX2/actions/workflows/build-all.yml)

ARMSX2 is a free and open-source PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator based on PCSX2. Its purpose is to emulate the PS2's hardware, using a combination of MIPS CPU [Interpreters](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)>), [Recompilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation) and a [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) which manages hardware states and PS2 system memory. This allows you to play PS2 games on your phone, PC, or gaming handheld, with many additional features and benefits.

## Thank You

The ARMSX2 team is eternally indebted to the [PCSX2 project](https://pcsx2.net) it is based on. We are so fortunate to build on their 20 years of hardcore development.

## About This Fork

[![Project Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/a1_zydGhVaE/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1_zydGhVaE)

The upstream PCSX2 project ships an ARM64 *interpreter* build for ARM, but its high-performance **JIT recompilers** (EE, IOP, VU0, VU1, and vtlb fast memory) are x86-64 only. 

**This fork exists to close that gap.** The goal is to preserve the correctness features of 20 years of PCSX2 development, while generating the fastest native ARM performance possible.

**Current status:**
- ✅ EE (Emotion Engine) recompiler — integer, float, MMI, COP0/COP1/COP2, branches, load/store
- ✅ IOP (I/O Processor / R3000A) recompiler — full integer, load/store, branches, coprocessors
- ✅ VU (Vector Unit) recompiler — microVU skeleton + Upper FMAC vector ISA complete; Lower ISA and runtime complete
- ✅ vtlb fast memory
- ✅ Native ARM64 binary builds and boots the PS2 BIOS
- ✅ 2D games are already playable
- ✅ 3D games run

### Why LLMs / AI Were Used

A word on methodology:

The x86-64 JIT code in upstream ARMSX2 is **already proven correct** — it has run thousands of PS2 titles for years. The challenge in this port is not emulator design or JIT theory; it is **mechanical translation** of a large, well-understood x86-64 assembly codebase into equivalent ARM64 assembly (via VIXL) while preserving the exact same register-allocation contracts, block lifecycle, and recompiler semantics.

Large language models (LLMs) were used as an **accelerant for this translation work** — pattern-matching x86 JIT boilerplate to ARM64 equivalents, scaffolding emit routines, and keeping the porting velocity high. The JIT *logic* (block compiler, dispatcher, analysis passes, flag pipelines, clamping rules, Tri-Ace hacks, etc.) is taken directly from the upstream x86 implementation and validated against it. **Nothing was hallucinated from scratch.**

In other words: the hard engineering was done by the PCSX2 team over two decades. The hard *typing* — translating ~50k lines of x86 emitter code into ARM64 — is what AI helped compress.

## iOS Dedicated External Display (Beta)

The iOS build includes an opt-in **Dedicated HDMI Output (Beta)** mode under
**Settings > Graphics > Display**:

- the existing Metal renderer moves to a connected external display without a
  second renderer, frame capture, or texture copy;
- normal iOS mirroring and the original phone gameplay UI remain unchanged
  while the setting is disabled or no dedicated target is active;
- aspect ratio is fitted and centered with black pillarbox/letterbox bars,
  without letting the external refresh rate change emulation speed;
- the existing PCSX2 performance OSD can be shown on HDMI while FullscreenUI
  remains off the television;
- the iPhone becomes a localized, OLED-black companion screen with access to
  the existing pause menu; and
- virtual controls are hidden and reset only while dedicated output is active.

This feature is marked **Beta** in every supported interface language. Normal
iOS mirroring remains the fallback, but dedicated-output behavior should still
be validated on each physical device, iOS version, HDMI adapter, and display
combination before relying on it.

The complete 2.6.7 manual HDMI test suite passed on an iPhone 17 Pro Max with
JIT enabled, including hot-plug, HDMI-only OSD, the OLED-black companion
screen, virtual-input suppression, and pause/resume. The Beta label remains
because other device, adapter, display, and future iOS combinations have not
been exhaustively covered.

### 2.6.7.1 HDMI OSD hotfix

The 2.6.7.1 hotfix adds **Show Viewport** under **Settings > Overlay (OSD)**.
When enabled, the performance overlay reports the active output surface and
refresh rate in a compact form such as:

```text
Viewport: 1920x1080-60Hz
```

The value comes from the render window actually owned by Metal, so dedicated
HDMI output reports the current external `UIScreenMode` pixel dimensions and
the refresh rate exposed by iOS. It is independent of the existing internal
game-resolution line.

This hotfix also normalizes HDMI OSD size by external video mode:

| Output | OSD scale |
|---|---:|
| 1280x720 | 66.7% |
| 1920x1080 | 100% |
| 2560x1440 | 150% |
| 3840x2160 | 200% |

Intermediate modes are interpolated. Metal clipping now uses the active
drawable texture dimensions, and performance-overlay positioning is clamped
to the viewport to prevent right-edge clipping during 4K mode changes.

The public hotfix version is **2.6.7.1**. To keep Apple bundle metadata valid,
the IPA uses `CFBundleShortVersionString=2.6.7`,
`CFBundleVersion=2671`, and exposes `ARMSX2ReleaseVersion=2.6.7.1` in
the app UI and troubleshooting information.

The 2.6.7.1 simulator build has been compiled, installed, and launched. Physical
1080p/1440p/4K output validation is intentionally pending on the iPhone 17 Pro
Max before this hotfix branch is proposed upstream.

for the architecture, lifecycle, validation status, known limitations, and
physical-device test checklist.

for the implementation and validation notes specific to this follow-up.

## System Requirements

ARMSX2 targets ARM64 across desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux) and mobile (Android, iOS/iPadOS), all from the single shared core. Our [setup documentation page](https://pcsx2.net/docs/setup/requirements) contains additional details on software and hardware requirements.

Please note that a BIOS dump from a legitimately-owned PS2 console is required to use the emulator. For more information, visit [this page](https://pcsx2.net/docs/setup/bios/).
